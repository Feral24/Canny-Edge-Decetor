// Canny Edge Detection Algorithm - OpenCV SW Implementation

// ECE 5775, Fall 2013
// Dec 5th, 2013
// 
// This file contains all of the subroutines which perform the
// Canny Edge Detection algorithm. It takes an image's pixel
// stream and pushes it's pixels one by one through the functional
// blocks below to perform the 5 stages of Canny Edge Detection.
// In the end it produces an output image highlighting just the edges
// of the input image.
//
// All of the C++ code below is non-synthesizable and uses subroutines
// from the OpenCV video processing libraries.

// This file is modified off a tutorial created by Xilinx, and as such
// we retain the below copyright notice and disclaimer.
